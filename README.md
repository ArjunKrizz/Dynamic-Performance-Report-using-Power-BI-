# Dynamic-Performance-Report-using-Power-BI


## Project Overview
This Power BI project focuses on building a Dynamic Performance Report that leverages Switch Measures and Conditional Formatting to analyze sales performance. The report enables users to dynamically switch between key metrics and compare Year-to-Date (YTD) and Prior Year-to-Date (PYTD) values to identify trends, pain points, and growth opportunities for a fictional company.

## Features
✅ Data Transformation: Importing and cleaning data from Excel using Power Query
✅ Data Modeling: Creating relationships, calculated columns, and a Date Table
✅ DAX Measures:

## Base Measures (Sales, Gross Profit, Quantity)
YTD & PYTD Calculations
Switch Measures for Dynamic Selection
Comparison Measure for YTD vs. PYTD
✅ Interactive Visuals:
Slicer-based Metric Selection
Conditional Formatting for Insights
Custom Background & Layout

## Dataset
The dataset consists of three key tables:

Fact Sales Table - Sales transactions with product, account, and invoice details
Dim Account Table - Customer details including location information
Dim Product Table - Product hierarchy with multiple levels
